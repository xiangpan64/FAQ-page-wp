== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do, exactly? =

It builds a login form and control panel in the sidebar of your page.

= Can I edit the CSS for the form and control panel? =

Yes, as of v5.0 a stylesheet editor has been included. If you don't like that stylesheet, or you have your own already, you also have the option to use your own stylesheet.

= The last version didn't support OpenID. What happened? =

Most were telling me they weren't using it or that it was dead. And from what I had seen, it seemed to be true. However, one user requested it again as that was the reason she chose my plugin. So I obliged.

= Does this work with EVERY OpenID plugin? =

No, this plugin only works with the plugin named [OpenID](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/ "Go Figure")
